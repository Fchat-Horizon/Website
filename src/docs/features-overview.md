## Features

Horizon contains a lot of featuresâ€” A lot of which can be disabled if you don't want them! A non exhaustive list is as follows:

### Profile Matching
Horizon automatically compares your profile with others on a score-based system to help you find suitable partners at a glance

### Automatic ad posting
Lazy? Need to step away for a bit? Automated ad posting will post ads for you, and randomly select them from a pool of your choice.

### Link previews
Links are previewed when hovering, and can even be pinned to the screen!

### Caching
Profiles load faster and take less resources to load

### Smart filters (Beta)
Allows you to hide what you don't want, and show what you do.

### Custom character colors & High quality portraits
Want high quality portraits? Simply place `[url=link.to.url.com]Horizon Portrait[/url]` in your characters bio. Want a custom color? Do `[color=colorname]Horizon Color[/color]` to set one as well!
